    ABSTRACT = {Localization is one of the key components in the operation of self-driving cars. Owing to the noisy global positioning system (GPS) signal and multipath routing in urban environments, a novel, practical approach is needed. In this study, a sensor fusion approach for self-driving cars was developed. To localize the vehicle position, we propose a particle-aided unscented Kalman filter (PAUKF) algorithm. The unscented Kalman filter updates the vehicle state, which includes the vehicle motion model and non-Gaussian noise affection. The particle filter provides additional updated position measurement information based on an onboard sensor and a high definition (HD) map. The simulations showed that our method achieves better precision and comparable stability in localization performance compared to previous approaches.},
